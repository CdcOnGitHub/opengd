# OpenGD
A reconstrunction of Geometry Dash using decompiled android versions with our edits so the code is cleaner overall.<br>
We are using cocos2dx 4.0.<br>
We are first going to remake 1.0 and then move on to later versions.<br>
The whole project is entirely open source except game assets.<br>
<br>
For now it is under development.

## TODO list for 1.0
- [x] LoadingLayer implementation
- [ ] Level Renderer implementation
- [ ] Online, Main and Garage menues
- [ ] Level Data builder and parser
- [ ] Networking features

## Running the game:
You can download the latest build in the releases tab. But you would need resources for it which are not present in the repo. For better structuring, OpenGD stores game assets in separate folders. To separate the assets from the original GD you can use `reallocate.sh`.
